# EVM-Hardhat-Template
An EVM Hardhat  project template which implements some nice QoL features like env management, typechain and some utilities I find useful.

## INSTALL

Clone and navigate to the repo, then install: 

```bash
yarn install
```

## USAGE 

Write contracts in the `contracts/` directory. To compile, call: 

```bash
yarn compile
```

This will generate the artifacts and ABIs normally. Additionally, it will generate Typechain bindings.
